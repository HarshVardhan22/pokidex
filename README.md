# Checkout this application :  https://pokidex-react.netlify.app/

# I have made this application in React

# Core Features :
 1. Fetches results from "https://pokeapi.co/"
 2. User can limit the nuumber of pokems to load per page (improves performance)
 3. User can search Pokemons by Name
 4. User can iterate between unique set of pokemons using "Next" and "Prev" buttons
 5. User can click on "Know more" to get more details of the pokem and then user will be routed to a different page.
 6. User can sort Pokemons by Name

# Notes:
I have made this application as an SPA by usign React Routers and to implement core feature 5,
I have used the concept of event delegation which actually uses the concept of event bubbling. This allowed me to use 
only 1 event listener to perform all the routing from homePage to Details page.


# Upcoming Features:
1. Dark mode
2. Mobile responsive
